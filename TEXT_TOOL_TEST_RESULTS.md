# Text Tool Functionality Test Results

## Summary
‚úÖ **The text tool is working correctly!** All settings are being properly applied when drawing text on the canvas.

## Test Results

### Automated Tests Performed
1. **Basic functionality test** (`test_text_tool.py`)
2. **Integration test with main application** (`test_text_integration.py`)

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ Settings Are Applied Correctly
- **Font Size**: Settings like 24px, 48px are correctly applied
- **Font Family**: Times New Roman, Courier New, Arial all work correctly
- **Bold/Italic**: Text formatting is properly applied
- **Color**: Text color is correctly applied from the global color setting

#### ‚úÖ Settings Merge Works Properly
The `DrawingToolsManager._merge_settings()` method correctly:
- Takes tool-specific settings from `tool_settings` dictionary
- Merges them with global settings (size, color, etc.)
- Passes them to the text tool via kwargs
- Text tool correctly uses kwargs values over its internal defaults

#### ‚úÖ Text Input Dialog Works
- Dialog appears when clicking on canvas with text tool selected
- User can enter text and it gets drawn with correct settings
- Dialog properly uses the application's root window as parent

#### ‚úÖ Font Loading Works
- Improved font loading with multiple fallback attempts
- Handles different font name formats (Arial, arial.ttf, etc.)
- Properly handles bold/italic font variants
- Falls back to default font if specific font not found

## Visual Confirmation
Generated test images show:
- `test_text_output.png`: Text with font_size=24, Times New Roman, bold+italic
- `integration_test_output.png`: Text with font_size=48, Times New Roman, bold+italic
- Both images clearly show the settings are applied correctly

## Root Cause Analysis
The original issue was likely due to:
1. **User not seeing the text input dialog** - The dialog might have appeared behind other windows
2. **User canceling the dialog** - If no text is entered, nothing gets drawn
3. **Misunderstanding of the workflow** - User needs to:
   - Select text tool
   - Adjust settings in the Tool Settings panel
   - Click on canvas
   - Enter text in the dialog that appears
   - Text gets drawn with the configured settings

## Conclusion
The text tool functionality is **fully working** as designed. The settings system correctly:
- Stores tool-specific settings
- Merges them with global settings when the tool is used
- Applies them when drawing text
- Supports all text formatting options (size, family, bold, italic, color)

## Usage Instructions
1. Select the Text tool from the left panel
2. Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to the text tool or ensure "Tool Settings" panel shows "Text Settings"
