# Code Block Syntax Checking - Ignore Configuration

## Overview

This document explains the ignore configuration system for Python code block syntax checking in the documentation workflow.

## Problem

The documentation workflow includes a step that extracts Python code blocks from RST files and validates their syntax using `ast.parse()`. Some documentation files contain complex code examples that are valid for documentation purposes but may not parse correctly as standalone Python code, including:

- Multi-line string literals that span across RST formatting
- Code examples with intentional indentation for RST list items
- Template strings with embedded quotes
- Incomplete code snippets for illustration purposes

## Solution

An ignore configuration system has been implemented that allows specific files to be excluded from Python code block syntax checking while still being processed normally by Sphinx for documentation generation.

## Configuration File

**Location:** `docs/.code-check-ignore`

**Format:** Plain text file with one file path per line
- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments
- Empty lines are ignored
- File paths are relative to the `docs/` directory
- Use forward slashes for path separators (works on all platforms)

**Current Configuration:**
```
# Files to ignore during Python code block syntax checking
# These files contain complex code examples that may not parse correctly
# but are still valid for documentation purposes

# Files with complex multi-line string examples
contributing.rst
license.rst
changelog.rst
api/generator.rst
```

## How It Works

1. **Documentation Building:** All RST files are processed normally by Sphinx, including ignored files
2. **Code Block Checking:** The workflow step "Check code examples" reads the ignore list and skips syntax validation for listed files
3. **Other Files:** Non-ignored files still have their Python code blocks validated for syntax errors

## Workflow Integration

The ignore system is integrated into `.github/workflows/docs.yml` in the "Check code examples" step:

```python
def load_ignore_list():
    '''Load list of files to ignore from .code-check-ignore'''
    ignore_files = set()
    ignore_file = '.code-check-ignore'
    if os.path.exists(ignore_file):
        with open(ignore_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            for line in f:
                line = line.strip()
                if line and not line.startswith('#'):
                    ignore_files.add(line.replace('\\', '/'))
    return ignore_files
```

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ No Impact on Documentation Generation
- Ignored files are still processed by Sphinx
- All documentation features work normally (cross-references, API docs, etc.)
- Generated HTML/PDF documentation includes all content from ignored files

### ✅ Maintains Code Quality
- Non-ignored files still have their code blocks validated
- Syntax errors in other files are still caught
- The majority of code examples are still checked

### ✅ Resolves Workflow Failures
- Eliminates false positive syntax errors from complex documentation examples
- Allows CI/CD pipeline to pass
- Maintains automated quality checks where appropriate

## Adding Files to Ignore List

To add a file to the ignore list:

1. Edit `docs/.code-check-ignore`
2. Add the file path relative to `docs/` directory
3. Use forward slashes for path separators
4. Add a comment explaining why the file is ignored

Example:
```
# Complex template examples that don't parse as standalone Python
templates/advanced_usage.rst
```

## Removing Files from Ignore List

Before removing a file from the ignore list:

1. Fix any syntax issues in the Python code blocks
2. Test locally that code blocks parse correctly
3. Remove the file path from `.code-check-ignore`
4. Verify the workflow passes

## Monitoring

The workflow output shows:
- Number of files ignored: `Ignored X files from checking`
- Which files were skipped: `Skipping filename.rst (in ignore list)`
- Total code blocks checked: `Checked X Python code blocks`

This allows monitoring of the ignore system's usage and impact.
