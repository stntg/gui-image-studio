Migration Guide
---------------

**From 0.9.x to 1.0.0**

**Breaking Changes:**
- Function names have been standardized

- Configuration file format changed

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Update function calls:**

   .. code-block:: python

      # Old (0.9.x)
      image = load_image("photo.jpg")
      tinted = tint_image(image, "#FF0000")
      
      # New (1.0.0)
      image = gui_image_studio.get_image("photo.jpg")
      tinted = gui_image_studio.apply_tint(image, "#FF0000")

2. **Update CLI commands:**

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Old (0.9.x)
