# Development Summaries

This folder contains summary files that document development activities,
setups, and changes made to the project.

## üìã Summary Types

### Automatic Summaries

These are created automatically by `dev_tools.py` when you use development commands:

- **FEATURE** - Created when starting new feature branches
- **RELEASE** - Created when starting release processes  
- **TEST** - Created when running local package tests

### Manual Summaries

These are created manually to document significant changes or setups:

- **SETUP** - Major configuration or setup activities
- **GENERAL** - General development activities or notes

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

Summary files follow this naming pattern:

```text
SUMMARY_{TYPE}_{TIMESTAMP}.md
```

Examples:

- `SUMMARY_FEATURE_20241201_143022.md`
- `SUMMARY_RELEASE_20241201_150045.md`
- `SETUP_SUMMARY_DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md`

## üöÄ Creating Summaries

### Automatic (via dev_tools.py)

```bash
# These commands automatically create summaries:
python dev_tools.py feature my-feature    # Creates FEATURE summary
python dev_tools.py release 1.0.1         # Creates RELEASE summary
python dev_tools.py test                  # Creates TEST summary
```

### Manual

```bash
# Create a custom summary
python dev_tools.py summary "My Task Title" "Description of what was accomplished"
```

## üìö Summary Contents

Each summary file includes:

- **Date and time** of the activity
- **Type** of activity (FEATURE, RELEASE, TEST, etc.)
- **Detailed description** of what was done
- **Next steps** or follow-up actions needed
- **Status** of the activity

## üîç Finding Summaries

### Recent Activities

```bash
# List recent summaries (newest first)
ls -la dev/SUMMARY_* | head -10

# Or on Windows
dir dev\SUMMARY_* /O-D
```

### By Type

```bash
# Find all feature summaries
ls dev/SUMMARY_FEATURE_*

# Find all release summaries  
ls dev/SUMMARY_RELEASE_*
```

### By Date

```bash
# Find summaries from today
ls dev/SUMMARY_*$(date +%Y%m%d)*

# Find summaries from specific date
ls dev/SUMMARY_*20241201*
```

## üìñ Reading Summaries

Each summary is a Markdown file that can be:

- Viewed in any text editor
- Rendered in GitHub/IDE with Markdown support
- Searched using grep/findstr for specific content

Example search:

```bash
# Find all summaries mentioning "TestPyPI"
grep -r "TestPyPI" dev/

# Find all release summaries for version 1.0
grep -r "1\.0\." dev/SUMMARY_RELEASE_*
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Organization Tips

### Keep Important Summaries

- Major setup summaries (like `SETUP_SUMMARY_DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md`)
- Release summaries for production versions
- Summaries documenting significant architectural changes

### Archive Old Summaries

Consider moving older summaries to an `archive/` subfolder:

```bash
mkdir dev/archive
mv dev/SUMMARY_*202411* dev/archive/  # Archive November summaries
```

## üéØ Benefits

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Review summaries** before major releases
