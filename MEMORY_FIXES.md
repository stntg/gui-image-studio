# Memory Management Fixes for GUI Image Studio

## Problem
The application was experiencing `_tkinter.TclError: not enough free memory for image buffer` errors, particularly during image rotation operations. This was caused by:

1. Accumulation of `ImageTk.PhotoImage` objects without proper cleanup
2. Large images being processed without size limits
3. Excessive zoom levels creating very large display images
4. No garbage collection after memory-intensive operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Automatic PhotoImage Cleanup
- **Location**: `update_canvas()` method (line ~2729)
- **Fix**: Properly delete old PhotoImage objects before creating new ones
- **Code**: 
  ```python
  if self.selected_image in self.image_previews:
      old_photo = self.image_previews[self.selected_image]
      del old_photo
  ```

### 2. Image Size Limits
- **Loading Limit**: 4096x4096 pixels maximum for loading images
- **Display Limit**: 2048x2048 pixels maximum for display
- **Location**: `load_image()` and `update_canvas()` methods
- **Benefit**: Prevents loading/displaying images that would cause memory issues

### 3. Conservative Zoom Limits
- **Previous**: 10x maximum zoom
- **New**: 5x maximum zoom
- **Location**: `zoom_in()` method (line ~2112)
- **Benefit**: Prevents creation of extremely large display images

### 4. Garbage Collection
- **Added**: `import gc` and strategic `gc.collect()` calls
- **Locations**: 
  - After rotation operations
  - In cleanup methods
  - After zoom operations
- **Benefit**: Forces Python to free unused memory immediately

### 5. Rotation Safety Checks
- **Location**: `apply_rotation()` method (line ~3343)
- **Features**:
  - Pre-calculation of rotated image size
  - Warning for rotations that would create oversized images
  - Memory cleanup before rotation
  - Error handling for memory issues

### 6. Error Handling
- **Added**: Try-catch blocks around PhotoImage creation
- **Benefit**: Graceful handling of memory errors with user-friendly messages
- **Fallback**: Automatic zoom reset when memory issues occur

### 7. Application Cleanup
- **Added**: `on_closing()` method and `__del__()` destructor
- **Features**:
  - Proper cleanup of all images and previews on exit
  - Icon cleanup
  - Window close protocol handler

### 8. Memory Monitoring (Optional)
- **Dependency**: psutil (optional)
- **Feature**: Warns users when memory usage exceeds 500MB
- **Location**: `check_memory_usage()` method
- **Benefit**: Proactive memory management

### 9. Periodic Cleanup
- **Feature**: Automatic cleanup every 10 canvas updates
- **Location**: `update_canvas()` method
- **Benefit**: Prevents gradual memory accumulation

## Usage Recommendations

1. **For Large Images**: Resize images to under 4096x4096 before loading
2. **For Memory Issues**: 
   - Reduce zoom level
   - Close unused images
   - Use 90-degree rotations instead of arbitrary angles
   - Restart application if memory usage gets high

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python test_memory_fix.py
```

## Files Modified

- `src/gui_image_studio/image_studio.py`: Main application file with all memory management improvements
- `test_memory_fix.py`: Test script to verify the fixes

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Significantly reduced memory usage and eliminated memory errors
- **Minimal**: Slight performance overhead from garbage collection calls
- **User Experience**: Better stability and error handling
